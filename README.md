# SpaceScape
The SpaceScape project is a prototype that utilizes Replicate's AI model to generate interior design images. It allows users to input various parameters and receive AI-generated designs based on their preferences. The project is built using Next.js, and features a clean, user-friendly interface, focusing on an enhanced user experience.

Key aspects of SpaceScape include:

AI Integration: It leverages Replicate's AI model to create custom interior designs, allowing for real-time generation of images based on user input.
UI/UX: The project emphasizes a seamless design experience, with a well-thought-out, minimalistic layout.
Guest Login: The project includes a guest login feature where users can generate one image for free, using rate limiting and IP-based validation to manage access.
